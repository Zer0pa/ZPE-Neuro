## What This Is

401× compression on extracellular neural recordings; every replay bit-identical. Anchored on DANDI 000034 with IBL second-target PASS.

ZPE-Neuro targets neurotech research-infrastructure teams and academic neuroscience platforms where non-deterministic compression pipelines make spike sorting, population decoding, and cross-session comparison irreproducible. This repo carries the Wave-1 neural signal package, curated proof corpus, and release-surface documentation. Scoped strictly to extracellular data — not broad neural generality.

AJILE12 out-of-family handling is explicitly documented rather than silently excluded. Unresolved blind-clone and commercialization gates remain open.

## What We Prove

> Auditable guarantees backed by committed proof artifacts. Start at `AUDITOR_PLAYBOOK.md`.

- DANDI 000034 extracellular validation with deterministic round-trip fidelity
- IBL second-target PASS under bounded refinement conditions
- Both datasets are real public with auditable lineage
- AJILE12 out-of-family handling explicitly documented

## What We Don't Claim

- No claim of blind-clone verification
- No claim of commercialization-safe closure
- No claim of tagged release
- No claim beyond extracellular lane

### Authority Detail

| Field | Current truth | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Authority snapshot date | `2026-03-21` | [proofs/manifests/CURRENT_AUTHORITY_PACKET.md](proofs/manifests/CURRENT_AUTHORITY_PACKET.md) |
| Repository / acquisition surface | Canonical GitHub repo: `https://github.com/Zer0pa/ZPE-Neuro` for authorized readers. Clone surface for authorized readers: `git clone https://github.com/Zer0pa/ZPE-Neuro.git`. | `AUDITOR_PLAYBOOK.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Repo posture | `PRIVATE_STAGED`. Package, install, docs, and proof surfaces are aligned for the current repo state, but this is not a public release and not a clean-clone-closed authority packet. | `RELEASING.md`, `PUBLIC_AUDIT_LIMITS.md` |
| Top unresolved gate | A fresh clean-clone replay of the authority packet remains the top unresolved acceptance gate. | `RELEASING.md` |
| Gate status | `OPEN` for blind-clone and public-release gates. `PASS` for the current clean packaged baseline and the tracked release-alignment gate slice. | [proofs/selected_artifacts/2026-03-21_zpe_neuro_release_alignment/](proofs/selected_artifacts/2026-03-21_zpe_neuro_release_alignment/README.md) |
| Current lane / scope lock | Lane 1 is a narrow extracellular recording lane. AJILE12 is explicitly `OUT_OF_FAMILY` for the current codec; broader human or intracranial coverage is not claimed here. | `proofs/selected_artifacts/2026-03-21_zpe_neuro_ibl_refinement/public_corpus_summary.json` |
| Primary positive public anchor | DANDI `000034` remains the strongest positive public waveform anchor in the current repo surface. | `proofs/selected_artifacts/2026-03-21_zpe_neuro_ibl_refinement/public_corpus_summary.json` |
| Counted breadth verdict | `PASS` in the current bounded local evidence packet after the March 21 IBL refinement. This does not upgrade blind-clone status or broader release claims. | `proofs/selected_artifacts/2026-03-21_zpe_neuro_ibl_refinement/public_corpus_summary.json` |
| Family-boundary decision | `OUT_OF_FAMILY` for AJILE12 in the current lane. | `proofs/selected_artifacts/2026-03-21_zpe_neuro_ibl_refinement/public_corpus_summary.json` |
| Packaged clean baseline | `PASS` for the packaged `.`, `.[gate]`, `.[public]`, and `.[proof]` surfaces that are actually declared for clean install/import. IBL chunked-waveform tooling and Allen parity remain operator-only. | `proofs/selected_artifacts/2026-03-21_zpe_neuro_release_alignment/verification_summary.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Blind-clone verification status | `OPEN` | `PUBLIC_AUDIT_LIMITS.md`, `RELEASING.md` |
| Release status | `NO_PUBLIC_RELEASE`. The current repo surface is documented and internally coherent, but no public-release verdict is claimed. | `RELEASING.md` |
| Commercialization status | `OPEN`. Allen parity and commercialization closure remain unresolved. | `docs/LEGAL_BOUNDARIES.md`, `RELEASING.md` |
| Primary authority artifacts | `proofs/manifests/CURRENT_AUTHORITY_PACKET.md`, `proofs/selected_artifacts/2026-03-21_zpe_neuro_release_alignment/`, `proofs/selected_artifacts/2026-03-21_zpe_neuro_ibl_refinement/` | `proofs/README.md` |
| Audit route | Start with the short replay path, then read the limits note before widening any claim. | `AUDITOR_PLAYBOOK.md`, `PUBLIC_AUDIT_LIMITS.md` |

## Tests and Verification

| Code | Check | Verdict |

### Runtime Proof And Package Truth

| Surface | Current state | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Core package build/import | `PASS` | The repo now ships a truthful Python package surface rather than relying on undeclared runtime assumptions. |
| Repo-local tests | `PASS` on the current shipped unit slice | The staged code surface has a small but real regression check that ships with the repo. |
| Synthetic gate baseline | `PASS` for sequential Gate C and Gate D replay in the current clean packaged gate stack | This is the strongest current shipped replay baseline in the repo. |
| Public replay import surface | `PASS` for the declared `.[proof]` import stack | This keeps the docs honest about what the packaged replay stack actually installs cleanly. |
| IBL and Allen operator paths | `OPERATOR_ONLY` | Those paths currently require manual dependency or toolchain work around `ONE-api`, `ibl-neuropixel`, `llvmlite` or `numba`, or `allensdk` conflicts and are intentionally not shipped as clean extras. |
| Release automation | `PASS` for static verification coverage | The repo now has a verification workflow that checks package, build, and install truth without implying a live publish pipeline or automated publish step. |

### Proof Corpus

| Packet | Class | How to read it |
|---|---|---|
| [proofs/manifests/CURRENT_AUTHORITY_PACKET.md](proofs/manifests/CURRENT_AUTHORITY_PACKET.md) | `CURRENT` | The routing manifest for what is current, what is historical, and which packet owns each claim layer. |

<a id="open-risks"></a>
### Open Risks

| Surface | Class | Current truth |
|---|---|---|
| Blind-clone authority pack | `OPEN` | The repo does not yet prove a fresh blind-clone authority replay. |
| Public release | `OPEN` | No tagged or public release readiness is claimed from this repo state. |
| IBL / Allen operator paths | `OPERATOR_ONLY` | These remain outside the clean packaged release surface because the upstream dependency chains are not currently truthful for a clean install. |
| Commercialization closure | `OPEN` | Allen parity and commercialization-safe closure remain unresolved. |
| Broader neural scope | `PARKED_BY_SCOPE` | Broader human or intracranial coverage is outside the current lane. |
| Historical path residue | `KNOWN_RESIDUE` | Some tracked runtime artifacts still contain machine-absolute paths inside captured traces. They are evidence lineage, not current filesystem instructions. |

## Quick Start

Acquire from the private GitHub repo if you have authorized access, then verify the shipped package surface from a checkout.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zer0pa/ZPE-Neuro.git
cd ZPE-Neuro

python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
python -c "import zpe_neuro"
```

Repo-local test slice:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python -m pytest tests
```

Repo-local synthetic gate slice:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[gate,dev]'
python tools/run_gate_c.py --artifact-root artifacts/manual_gate_c --seed 20260220
python tools/run_gate_d.py --artifact-root artifacts/manual_gate_d --replay-seeds 20260220,20260221,20260222,20260223,20260224
```

Repo-local clean public replay import surface:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[proof]'
```

The `tools/` runners are repo-local scripts, not installed console entry points. `LICENSE` is the legal source of truth. Read `docs/LEGAL_BOUNDARIES.md` before turning any repo result into a wider legal or commercial claim.

## Who This Is For

| | |
|---|---|
| **Ideal first buyer** | Neurotech research-infrastructure team or academic neuroscience platform needing deterministic signal encoding with proof lineage |
| **Pain** | Neural recording pipelines lack reproducibility guarantees — re-analyses produce different outputs across environments, eroding audit trust |
| **Deployment** | Python package (`pip install -e .`), private staged. Not currently distributed as a public package |
| **Family position** | Validates ZPE encoding generality to neural signal domains. Staged/validation tier alongside Mocap, Prosody, and Bio |
